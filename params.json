  "body": "Welcome to the tutorial website for the tutorial \"Bio-ontologies and their role in analyzing personal genome data\". The tutorial will initially be presented at [ECCB 2016](http://www.eccb2016.org/) on 4 September 2016.\r\n\r\n# Aim\r\n\r\nThe aim of the tutorial is to introduce recent advances in **using biomedical ontologies for data analysis**, in particular for the **interpretation of personal genome data** and identifying **causal variants** underlying a phenotype or disease.\r\n\r\n# Target audience\r\n\r\nThe tutorial is aimed at **computational biologists** and (bio-)medical **informaticians** interested in incorporating ontologies, in particular phenotype ontologies, into their analysis pipelines. **Clinicians**, **biologists**, and **pharmacologists** with basic informatics expertise will also find the course accessible and useful.\r\n\r\n# Presenters\r\n\r\n* [Dr Paul N Schofield](http://www.pdn.cam.ac.uk/directory/paul-schofield), University Reader in Biomedical Informatics, Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge\r\n* [Prof Robert Hoehndorf](http://leechuck.de), Assistant Professor of Computer Science, Computational Bioscience Research Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology\r\n* [Prof Georgios V Gkoutos](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/cancer-genomic/gkoutos-georgios.aspx), Professor of Clinical Bioinformatics, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, Centre for Computational Biology, University of Birmingham\r\n* Ms Imene Boudellioua, PhD student, Computational Bioscience Research Center, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology\r\n\r\n# Tutorial outline\r\n\r\n| Time \t| Topic\t| Presenter | Slides| Lecture materials, additional reading |\r\n|---\t|---\t|---\t|--- |--- |\r\n| 9:00-9:45 | Welcome and introduction; the role of ontologies in biology, biomedicine and disease genetics | Paul Schofield | tbd | [The role of ontologies in biological and biomedical research: a functional perspective](http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/6/1069) |\r\n| 9:45-11:00 | Ontology Basics: classes, relations, axioms; relations between ontologies and graphs; the Web Ontology Language (OWL) | Robert Hoehndorf | tbd | [Relations as patterns: bridging the gap between OBO and OWL](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-11-441)|\r\n| 10:30-11:00 | Coffee Break | all | | |\r\n| 11:00-12:30 | Phenotype ontologies: PATO and EQ | George Gkoutos | tbd | [Building mouse phenotype ontologies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14992502) |\r\n| 12:30-13:30 | Lunch break | All | | [Diet and Weight Management](http://www.webmd.com/diet/) |\r\n| 13:30-14:15 | Informatics of phenotype ontologies, computational analysis of phenotype data | Robert Hoehndorf |[Lecture slides](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/ontology-and-phenotype-tutorial/raw/master/informatics-of-phenotypes/informatics.pdf) | [PhenomeNET: a whole-phenome approach to disease gene discovery](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3185433/)|\r\n| 14:15-15:00 | The role of ontologies in the analysis of personal genome data | Imene Boudellioua | tbd | [Improved exome prioritization of disease genes through cross-species phenotype comparison](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/24/2/340.long) |\r\n|15:00-15:30 | Coffee Break | all | | |\r\n|15:30-16:15 | Complex diseases, physiology, disease modules and networks | Paul Schofield | tbd | |\r\n| 16:15-17:00 | Discussion: discuss problems brought up by the audience; ontologies and the EHR; ontology mapping | all | tbd | |\r\n\r\n# Requirements by participants\r\n\r\nAll participants must have a laptop with Protege installed and a web browser to access BioPortal and AberOWL.\r\n\r\n# Materials\r\n\r\nHere you will soon find all materials developed for the tutorial, including slides, lecture notes, software tools and reading material.\r\n\r\n## Slides\r\n\r\n## Lecture notes\r\n\r\n## Software and libraries\r\n\r\nWorking with ontologies:\r\n* [Protege Ontology Editor](http://protege.stanford.edu/)\r\n* [BioPortal](http://bioportal.bioontology.org)\r\n* [AberOWL](http://aber-owl.net)\r\n\r\nOntology Matching:\r\n* [AgreementMaker Light](https://github.com/AgreementMakerLight)\r\n\r\nAnalyzing genomic data with ontologies:\r\n* [Exomiser](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/exomiser)\r\n* [PhenomeNET](http://phenomebrowser.net)\r\n\r\nLibraries, mainly for developers (optional, not required for the tutorial):\r\n* [OWL API](http://owlapi.sourceforge.net)\r\n* [ELK Reasoner](https://github.com/liveontologies/elk-reasoner)\r\n* [Semantic Measures Library](http://www.semantic-measures-library.org/)\r\n\r\n## Additional reading material\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nFor any questions related to the tutorial, or requests for topics to cover in the course, please send a mail to [phenotype-ontology-tutorial@googlegroups.com](mailto:phenotype-ontology-tutorial@googlegroups.com).
